                <div id="p1"><h3>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3></div>

                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>a) Information You Give Us </strong></li>
                  </ol>
                  We collect personal information that you voluntarily share with us through the Site. For example, we collect information when you fill out a request form on the Site.

                  <br><br>

                  The information we collect from you may include:

                  <br><br>

                  Account information, other than your username and password, is previously provided to Innovations and is not collected through the Site.

                  <br><br>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>b) Information We Collect Through Technology On The Site </strong></li>
                  </ol>
                  We collect information through technology to enhance our ability to serve you. When you access and use the Site, Innovations and, in some cases, our third-party service providers collect information about how you interact with the Site. We describe below a few of the methods we use to collect information through technology.

                  <br><br>

                  When you visit the Site, we collect your device identifier, browser information, and Internet Protocol (IP) address. An IP address is often associated with the portal you used to enter the Internet, like your Internet service provider (ISP), company, association, or university. While an IP address may reveal your ISP or geographic area, we cannot determine your identity solely based upon your IP address. We do not link your personal information to device identifier information, browser information, and IP addresses.

                  <br><br>
                  <strong>Do We Use Cookies?</strong><br>

                  Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser that enables the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. We use cookies to help us understand and save your preferences for future visits to the Site. For example, when you return to the Site after logging in, cookies provide information to the Site so that the Site will remember who you are.

                  <br><br>

                  If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off cookies by adjusting your browser settings. Like most websites, if you turn your cookies off, some of the features on the Site may not function properly.

                  <br><br>

                  <strong>Google Analytics</strong><br>

                  We use cookies provided by Google Analytics, a third-party service provider, to assist us in better understanding our Site visitors. These cookies collect data tied to a user’s IP address such as the length of time a user spends on a page, the pages a user visits, and the websites a user visits before and after visiting the Site. Based on this information, Google Analytics compiles aggregate data about Site traffic and Site interactions, which we use to offer better Site experiences and tools in the future. Google Analytics does not collect any personal information. You can obtain more information about Google Analytics here: <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>

                  <br><br>

                  <strong>Your ‘Do Not Track’ Browser Setting</strong><br>

                  We do not support the Do Not Track (DNT) browser setting. DNT is a preference you can set in your browser’s settings to let the websites you visit know that you do not want the websites collecting your personal information.  However, aside from tracking the website a user visits immediately before and after visiting the Site, the Site does not track users across different websites and over time.

                  The security and confidentiality of your personal information is important to us. We have technical, administrative, and physical security measures in place to protect your personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure and improper use.

                  <br><br>

                  For example, we use SSL encryption to protect the data collection forms on our website. In addition, access to your personal information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to personal information. Employees with access to personal information are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.

                  <br><br>

                  It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to log out of your account or to close your browser after you have completed your visit to the Site.

                  <br><br>

                  Please note that despite our reasonable efforts, no security measure is ever perfect or impenetrable, so we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.
