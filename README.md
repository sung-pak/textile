## ABOUT

This project is the InnovationsUSA website.  We are evolving the site from a flat "online brochure" to a dynamic web application with a CMS and e-Commerce capabilities, including integration with our warehouse, client and, eventually, sales data.

The CMS has been implemented via Voyager.

## INSTALLATION AND SETUP

For now we are running on Laravel 7.x. You may be able to run the project on earlier or later versions of Laravel.

Just do the usual Laravel things -- set up a database, run composer install and npm install.  There may be additional steps for installing and configuring Voyager and other packages. If you run into any issues there, pay attention to any error messages and consult the documentation for the project in question.
